**Python Keylogger Project**

*Objective*

The purpose of this project was to develop a Python-based keylogger to understand how keyboard input can be captured and logged. This project provided hands-on experience with event-driven programming and file handling in Python while emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and security awareness in software development.

*Skills Learned*

-Implementing event listeners using Python libraries.

-Error handling to manage special and non-character key events.

-Understanding the ethical and legal aspects of cybersecurity tools.

-Understanding how data flows within a basic network.

*Tools Used*

Visual Studio Code: Used as the coding platform.
Python: Used as the primary programming language.
pynput Library: Captured and processed keyboard input.

*Steps*

1. Imported the pynput library to set up keyboard event listeners.
2. Created a function (keyPressed) to capture and log key presses.
3. Handled special keys and character inputs using a try-except block to ensure robustness.
4. Saved logged key data into a file named keyfile.txt for storage.
5. Tested the script in a controlled environment to verify its functionality.
